# Minimum TS-React storybook setup

Since I'm finally not the only one in our F2E team, I think it's probably a good timing to take a look at `Storybook`.

This is a basic setup for TS-React storybook, for vanilla JS might be much eaiser, and also support much concise and latest syntex... But whatever.

This setup includes the following addons:

- Storybook info addon  
  needs to be set specifically in every stories.

- Storybook knobs addon  
  has been hook into `.storybook/config.js`, can be used directly in every stories.

- Storybook action addon  
  can be use directly without any configuration.
